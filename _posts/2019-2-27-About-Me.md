title: Hi, I'm Stephen

I'm a student at Clemson University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with an Engineering minor, planning to graduate in May 2022.

In my free time I've enjoyed learning about web development, sometimes by creating full-stack web applications like [YouTube PhraseFinder](https://phrasefinder.net/) (built with Django and React).

![PhraseFinder](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4fc1166feebff544d084962f2c7ceee748537e6b/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f514d4d5a377a732f726573756c74732e706e67 "YouTube PhraseFinder")


In the Fall of 2019 I joined the TRACE Research Group at Clemson where I assist in the development of applications for use in research related to Team Cognition and Human-Computer Interaction. I love working with the lab because I get to learn about new technologies while solving difficult problems and answering interesting questions.

I made this website in hopes of finding more challenges like this, so if you like my work please don't hesitate to contact me at [StephenDonRussell@gmail.com](mailto:StephenDonRussell@gmail.com)!
