### About me

I'm a student at Clemson University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, planning to graduate in May 2022. Through school I've learned to program in C++, C, and Java, and as of Fall of 2019 I have joined the TRACE research group at Clemson where I assist in the development of applications for use in research related to Human-Centered Computing. 

In my free time I've enjoyed learning about web devlopment, using Python and JavaScript to create full-stack web applications like [YouTube PhraseFinder](https://github.com/StphnRssll/PhraseFinder).

With that said, I am really excited to get involved in solving real-world software problems wherever my skills may be needed. I am a fast learner, and if I am passionate about a project I won't sleep until it is completed and polished. 

I made this website in hopes of finding inspiring projects like this, so please don't hesitate to contact me at [StephenDonRussell@gmail.com](mailto:StephenDonRussell@gmail.com)
