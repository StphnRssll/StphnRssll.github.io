### About me

I'm from Murrells Inlet, SC, and I'm a Computer Science student at Clemson University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science, graduating in May of 2022. When I'm not studying or working I'm usually toying with side projects, playing guitar, or listening to audiobooks. I'm always interested in learning and trying new things.

My goal is to utilize my knowledge and skills in an environment which allows me to learn about engineering, software development, and business operations.
