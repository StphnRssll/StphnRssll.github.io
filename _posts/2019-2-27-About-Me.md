### About me

I'm a student at Clemson University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, planning to graduate in May 2022. Through school I've learned to program in C++, C, and Java, and in my free time I've enjoyed learning about web devlopment, using Python and Javascript to create full-stack applications like [YouTube PhraseFinder](https://github.com/StphnRssll/PhraseFinder). 

![PhraseFinder](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4fc1166feebff544d084962f2c7ceee748537e6b/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f514d4d5a377a732f726573756c74732e706e67 "YouTube PhraseFinder")


With that said, I am really excited to get involved in solving real-world software problems wherever my skills may be needed. I am a fast learner, and if I am passionate about a project I won't sleep until it is completed to my standards. I made this website in hopes of finding a project like this, so please don't hesitate to reach out with opportunities: [SRusse5@clemson.edu](mailto:SRusse5@clemson.edu)
